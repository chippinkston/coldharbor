# coldharbor
## Overview
This project is to provide a framework for working with the Docker Remote API.  At it's most basic, it's designed to allow for a simple reporting of container status.

## Vagrant
This project will ship with a very basic `Vagrantfile` which will stand up a virtual machine running docker and configured to be open for polling.
